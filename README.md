## Introduction

A cool handy script for managing your vulnerability results.

## Features

- Interactive loading animation.
- Scans specific files or all files in a directory.
- Categorizes vulnerabilities as Low, Medium, High, and Critical.
- Displays a summary of vulnerabilities found.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/24allday/vulnerability-scanner.git

   cd nukegrep24
   ./nukegrep24
   ```
## Usage

    The script will display a loading animation and then present a menu to choose an option:
        Choose option 1 to scan specific files.
        Choose option 2 to scan all files in the current directory.

    If you choose option 1, you'll be prompted to enter the names of files to scan (separated by spaces).
    If you choose option2 , you'll begin scanning all files in the current directory.

    After scanning, the script will display a summary of vulnerabilities found. It is important to understand that this is a script to make extracting the information easier and is not a guaranteed extractor without false positives.
